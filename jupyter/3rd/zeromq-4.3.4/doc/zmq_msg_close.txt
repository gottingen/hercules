zmq_msg_close(3)
================


NAME
----
zmq_msg_close - release 0MQ message


SYNOPSIS
--------
*int zmq_msg_close (zmq_msg_t '*msg');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _zmq_msg_close()_ function shall inform the 0MQ infrastructure that any
resources associated with the message object referenced by 'msg' are no longer
required and may be released. Actual release of resources associated with the
message object shall be postponed by 0MQ until all users of the message or
underlying data buffer have indicated it is no longer required.

Applications should ensure that _zmq_msg_close()_ is called once a message is
no longer required, otherwise memory leaks may occur. Note that this is NOT
necessary after a successful _zmq_msg_send()_.

CAUTION: Never access 'zmq_msg_t' members directly, instead always use the
_zmq_msg_ family of functions.


RETURN VALUE
------------
The _zmq_msg_close()_ function shall return zero if successful. Otherwise
it shall return `-1` and set 'errno' to one of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
*EFAULT*::
Invalid message.
