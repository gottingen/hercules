.SH "NAME"
zmq_socket \- create 0MQ socket
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBvoid *zmq_socket (void \fR\fB\fI*context\fR\fR\fB, int \fR\fB\fItype\fR\fR\fB);\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \fIzmq_socket()\fR function shall create a 0MQ socket within the specified \fIcontext\fR and return an opaque handle to the newly created socket\&. The \fItype\fR argument specifies the socket type, which determines the semantics of communication over the socket\&.
.sp
The newly created socket is initially unbound, and not associated with any endpoints\&. In order to establish a message flow a socket must first be connected to at least one endpoint with \fBzmq_connect\fR(3), or at least one endpoint must be created for accepting incoming connections with \fBzmq_bind\fR(3)\&.
.PP
\fBKey differences to conventional sockets\fR. Generally speaking, conventional sockets present a
\fIsynchronous\fR
interface to either connection\-oriented reliable byte streams (SOCK_STREAM), or connection\-less unreliable datagrams (SOCK_DGRAM)\&. In comparison, 0MQ sockets present an abstraction of an asynchronous
\fImessage queue\fR, with the exact queueing semantics depending on the socket type in use\&. Where conventional sockets transfer streams of bytes or discrete datagrams, 0MQ sockets transfer discrete
\fImessages\fR\&.
.sp
0MQ sockets being \fIasynchronous\fR means that the timings of the physical connection setup and tear down, reconnect and effective delivery are transparent to the user and organized by 0MQ itself\&. Further, messages may be \fIqueued\fR in the event that a peer is unavailable to receive them\&.
.sp
Conventional sockets allow only strict one\-to\-one (two peers), many\-to\-one (many clients, one server), or in some cases one\-to\-many (multicast) relationships\&. With the exception of \fIZMQ_PAIR\fR and \fIZMQ_CHANNEL\fR, 0MQ sockets may be connected \fBto multiple endpoints\fR using \fIzmq_connect()\fR, while simultaneously accepting incoming connections \fBfrom multiple endpoints\fR bound to the socket using \fIzmq_bind()\fR, thus allowing many\-to\-many relationships\&.
.PP
\fBThread safety\fR. 0MQ has both thread safe socket type and
\fInot\fR
thread safe socket types\&. Applications MUST NOT use a
\fInot\fR
thread safe socket from multiple threads under any circumstances\&. Doing so results in undefined behaviour\&.
.sp
Following are the thread safe sockets: * ZMQ_CLIENT * ZMQ_SERVER * ZMQ_DISH * ZMQ_RADIO * ZMQ_SCATTER * ZMQ_GATHER * ZMQ_PEER * ZMQ_CHANNEL
.PP
\fBSocket types\fR. The following sections present the socket types defined by 0MQ, grouped by the general
\fImessaging pattern\fR
which is built from related socket types\&.
.SS "Client\-server pattern"
.sp
The client\-server pattern is used to allow a single \fIZMQ_SERVER\fR \fIserver\fR talk to one or more \fIZMQ_CLIENT\fR \fIclients\fR\&. The client always starts the conversation, after which either peer can send messages asynchronously, to the other\&.
.sp
The client\-server pattern is formally defined by \m[blue]\fBhttp://rfc\&.zeromq\&.org/spec:41\fR\m[]\&.

\fBZMQ_CLIENT\fR
.RS 4
.sp
A \fIZMQ_CLIENT\fR socket talks to a \fIZMQ_SERVER\fR socket\&. Either peer can connect, though the usual and recommended model is to bind the \fIZMQ_SERVER\fR and connect the \fIZMQ_CLIENT\fR\&.
.sp
If the \fIZMQ_CLIENT\fR socket has established a connection, \fBzmq_send\fR(3) will accept messages, queue them, and send them as rapidly as the network allows\&. The outgoing buffer limit is defined by the high water mark for the socket\&. If the outgoing buffer is full, or, for connection\-oriented transports, if the ZMQ_IMMEDIATE option is set and there is no connected peer, \fBzmq_send\fR(3) will block\&. The \fIZMQ_CLIENT\fR socket will not drop messages\&.
.sp
When a \fIZMQ_CLIENT\fR socket is connected to multiple \fIZMQ_SERVER\fR sockets, outgoing messages are distributed between connected peers on a round\-robin basis\&. Likewise, the \fIZMQ_CLIENT\fR socket receives messages fairly from each connected peer\&. This usage is sensible only for stateless protocols\&.
.sp
\fIZMQ_CLIENT\fR sockets are threadsafe and can be used from multiple threads at the same time\&. Note that replies from a \fIZMQ_SERVER\fR socket will go to the first client thread that calls \fBzmq_msg_recv\fR(3)\&. If you need to get replies back to the originating thread, use one \fIZMQ_CLIENT\fR socket per thread\&.

\fBZMQ_SERVER\fR
.RS 4
.sp
A \fIZMQ_SERVER\fR socket talks to a set of \fIZMQ_CLIENT\fR sockets\&. A \fIZMQ_SERVER\fR socket can only reply to an incoming message: the \fIZMQ_CLIENT\fR peer must always initiate a conversation\&.
.sp
Each received message has a \fIrouting_id\fR that is a 32\-bit unsigned integer\&. The application can fetch this with \fBzmq_msg_routing_id\fR(3)\&. To send a message to a given \fIZMQ_CLIENT\fR peer the application must set the peer\(cqs \fIrouting_id\fR on the message, using \fBzmq_msg_set_routing_id\fR(3)\&.
.sp
If the \fIrouting_id\fR is not specified, or does not refer to a connected client peer, the send call will fail with EHOSTUNREACH\&. If the outgoing buffer for the client peer is full, the send call shall block, unless ZMQ_DONTWAIT is used in the send, in which case it shall fail with EAGAIN\&. The \fIZMQ_SERVER\fR socket shall not drop messages in any case\&.

Radio\-dish is using groups (vs Pub\-sub topics), Dish sockets can join a group and each message sent by Radio sockets belong to a group\&.
.sp
Groups are null terminated strings limited to 16 chars length (including null)\&. The intention is to increase the length to 40 chars (including null)\&. The encoding of groups shall be UTF8\&.

Scatter\-gather pattern

.nf
The scatter\-gather pattern is the thread\-safe version of the pipeline pattern\&.
The scatter\-gather pattern is used for distributing data to _nodes_ arranged in
a pipeline\&. Data always flows down the pipeline, and each stage of the pipeline
is connected to at least one _node_\&. When a pipeline stage is connected to
multiple _nodes_ data is round\-robined among all connected _nodes_\&.

ZMQ_SCATTER
^^^^^^^^
A socket of type \*(AqZMQ_SCATTER\*(Aq is used by a scatter\-gather _node_ to send messages
to downstream scatter\-gather _nodes_\&. Messages are round\-robined to all connected
downstream _nodes_\&. The _zmq_recv()_ function is not implemented for this
socket type\&.

When a \*(AqZMQ_SCATTER\*(Aq socket enters the \*(Aqmute\*(Aq state due to having reached the
high water mark for all downstream _nodes_, or, for connection\-oriented transports,
if the ZMQ_IMMEDIATE option is set and there are no downstream _nodes_ at all,
then any linkzmq:zmq_send[3] operations on the socket shall block until the mute
state ends or at least one downstream _node_ becomes available for sending;
messages are not discarded\&.

NOTE: \*(AqZMQ_SCATTER\*(Aq sockets are threadsafe\&. They do not accept ZMQ_RCVMORE on receives\&.
This limits them to single part data\&.

\*(AqZMQ_CHANNEL\*(Aq socket\&.

When a \*(AqZMQ_CHANNEL\*(Aq socket enters the \*(Aqmute\*(Aq state due to having reached the
high water mark for the connected peer, or, for connection\-oriented transports,
if the ZMQ_IMMEDIATE option is set and there is no connected peer, then
any linkzmq:zmq_send[3] operations on the socket shall block until the peer
becomes available for sending; messages are not discarded\&.

While \*(AqZMQ_CHANNEL\*(Aq sockets can be used over transports other than linkzmq:zmq_inproc[7],
their inability to auto\-reconnect coupled with the fact new incoming connections will
be terminated while any previous connections (including ones in a closing state)
exist makes them unsuitable for TCP in most cases\&.

NOTE: \*(AqZMQ_CHANNEL\*(Aq sockets are designed for inter\-thread communication across

\fBZMQ_STREAM\fR

.sp
A socket of type \fIZMQ_STREAM\fR is used to send and receive TCP data from a non\-0MQ peer, when using the tcp:// transport\&. A \fIZMQ_STREAM\fR socket can act as client and/or server, sending and/or receiving TCP data asynchronously\&.
.sp
When receiving TCP data, a \fIZMQ_STREAM\fR socket shall prepend a message part containing the \fIrouting id\fR of the originating peer to the message before passing it to the application\&. Messages received are fair\-queued from among all connected peers\&.
.sp
When sending TCP data, a \fIZMQ_STREAM\fR socket shall remove the first part of the message and use it to determine the \fIrouting id\fR of the peer the message shall be routed to, and unroutable messages shall cause an EHOSTUNREACH or EAGAIN error\&.
.sp
To open a connection to a server, use the zmq_connect call, and then fetch the socket routing id using the zmq_getsockopt call with the ZMQ_ROUTING_ID option\&.
.sp
To close a specific connection, send the routing id frame followed by a zero\-length message (see EXAMPLE section)\&.
.sp
When a connection is made, a zero\-length message will be received by the application\&. Similarly, when the peer disconnects (or the connection is lost), a zero\-length message will be received by the application\&.
.sp
You must send one routing id frame followed by one data frame\&. The ZMQ_SNDMORE flag is required for routing id frames but is ignored on data frames\&.

\fBZMQ_ROUTER\fR
.RS 4
.sp
A socket of type \fIZMQ_ROUTER\fR is an advanced socket type used for extending request/reply sockets\&. When receiving messages a \fIZMQ_ROUTER\fR socket shall prepend a message part containing the \fIrouting id\fR of the originating peer to the message before passing it to the application\&. Messages received are fair\-queued from among all connected peers\&. When sending messages a \fIZMQ_ROUTER\fR socket shall remove the first part of the message and use it to determine the _routing id _ of the peer the message shall be routed to\&. If the peer does not exist anymore, or has never existed, the message shall be silently discarded\&. However, if \fIZMQ_ROUTER_MANDATORY\fR socket option is set to \fI1\fR, the socket shall fail with EHOSTUNREACH in both cases\&.
.sp
When a \fIZMQ_ROUTER\fR socket enters the \fImute\fR state due to having reached the high water mark for all peers, then any messages sent to the socket shall be dropped until the mute state ends\&. Likewise, any messages routed to a peer for which the individual high water mark has been reached shall also be dropped\&. If, \fIZMQ_ROUTER_MANDATORY\fR is set to \fI1\fR, the socket shall block or return EAGAIN in both cases\&.
.sp
When a \fIZMQ_ROUTER\fR socket has \fIZMQ_ROUTER_MANDATORY\fR flag set to \fI1\fR, the socket shall generate \fIZMQ_POLLIN\fR events upon reception of messages from one or more peers\&. Likewise, the socket shall generate \fIZMQ_POLLOUT\fR events when at least one message can be sent to one or more peers\&.
.sp
When a \fIZMQ_REQ\fR socket is connected to a \fIZMQ_ROUTER\fR socket, in addition to the \fIrouting id\fR of the originating peer each message received shall contain an empty \fIdelimiter\fR message part\&. Hence, the entire structure of each received message as seen by the application becomes: one or more \fIrouting id\fR parts, \fIdelimiter\fR part, one or more \fIbody parts\fR\&. When sending replies to a \fIZMQ_REQ\fR socket the application must include the \fIdelimiter\fR part\&.
