LLVM Introduction
====================

The LLVM official website is `llvm <https://llvm.org/>`_., LLVM is a collection of modular and reusable compiler
and toolchain technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines. The name "LLVM"
itself is not an acronym; it is the full name of the project. LLVM on github
is `llvm github <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project>`_. LLVM's documentation is available at `llvm documentation <https://llvm.org/docs/>`_.
LLVM's WIKI information about LLVM can be found at `llvm wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM>`_. The history
of LLVM and details about its development and projects there are many resources available on the internet. I won't
repeat it, let's go directly to our topic.

There sub-projects of `llvm` are used for `EA` develop, namely `llvm-project`, `clang`, `mlir`.
